## About Me

I'm a health science professional with a unique blend of expertise in kinesiology and data analytics. I have a BHSc in Kinesiology and Health Promotion from Sheridan College, and I'm currently expanding my skills through the Digital Health and Data Analytics program at The Michener Institute of Education at UHN.

My background in kinesiology, coupled with my growing proficiency in data analytics, allows me to approach health-related challenges from a multidimensional perspective. I'm passionate about leveraging data-driven insights to enhance health outcomes and optimize wellness strategies.

Throughout my career, I've worn many hats - from Personal Trainer and Corporate Wellness Specialist to Sales Representative in AI-driven companies. These experiences have honed my ability to communicate complex health and data concepts to diverse audiences.

I'm interested in exploring how data analytics can be applied to kinesiology and health promotion, aiming to develop innovative solutions that bridge the gap between physical wellness and digital health technologies.
